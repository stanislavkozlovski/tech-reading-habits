# Intro

Distributed Systems are insanely complex. I remember writing my [thorough introduction to distributed systems article](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/a-thorough-introduction-to-distributed-systems-3b91562c9b3c) and how long that took.
It really opened my eyes to the fact that you don't know something well until you actually write about it.
