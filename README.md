# tech-reading-habits
A repository where I keep track of all technical blog posts/books I've read or want to read

### Why
I've got a plethora on my read list for becoming a better Software Engineer. I typically keep Evernotes on things I've learned, but those are very detailed and hard to read through. I need a higher-level index of things I've learned that is easier to navigate. I also need somewhere to track what's the next best thing to learn.
This repository is the start of that! I'm also sharing it with the world.
